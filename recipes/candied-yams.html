<h2> A perfect thanksgiving addition! </h2>
<p> This is a meal I always love in the fall. I just wished it got made for more than thanksgiving! Anyway, this recipe might not be the exact same as the one my family uses, but I promise it's just as good! </p>
<h2> Ingredients </h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 (29 ounce) can sweet potatoes, drained</li>
		<li>¼ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
		<li>½ cup brown sugar</li>
		<li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
	</ul>
<h2> Steps </h2>
	<ol>
		<li> <strong> Drain the syrup: </strong> This is only applicable if you're using canned yams. As this refers to when you open a can and drain the liquid out. Like you'd do for a can of tuna, except for a can of yams. After this go ahead and put them in your pan of choice.</li>
		<li><strong> Dice the butter:</strong> The butter I usually use has tick marks that correlate to amounts of butter, so if yours has those I'd reccomend using those to measure the butter, and cutting along them before dsitrubing them evenly over the yams. If not just cut them into chunks about the size of the top section of your index finger.</li>
		<li><strong> Sprinkle with brown sugar: </strong> Measure the sugar in a measureing cup, and pack it down a bit to make sure you're measureing acuratley. Then go ahead and sprinkle it ontop of the yams and butter. You may want to transfer the sugar to a bowl before sprinkling it, as this gives you a chance to break it up if you packed it, allowing for a better and more even distribution of sugar.</li>
		<li><strong> Cover with mini marshmallows:</strong> Just pour the marshmellows over the top of the dish, and then use your hand or a spatulla to level them. They should cover the dish entirely and be in a single layer. Basically just put marshmallows on top.</li>
		<li><strong> Bake: </strong> You'll want to have preheated the oven to about 400 farenheight. Then you'll put in what you've previously assembled, and leave it in until the marshmellows are golden on the tips. </li>
</ol>
